# As a visitor
# When I visit a parent show page
# Then I see a link to delete the parent
# When I click the link "Delete Parent"
# Then a 'DELETE' request is sent to '/parents/:id',
# the parent is deleted, and all child records are deleted
# and I am redirected to the parent index page where I no longer see this parent
